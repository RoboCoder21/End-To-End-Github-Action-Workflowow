# End-To-End GitHub Action Workflow Project With Docker Hub

This project demonstrates an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Docker Hub. The goal is to automate the build, test, and deployment process of a Dockerized application.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Docker Hub account
- Basic knowledge of Docker and GitHub Actions

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. **Create a Dockerfile:**
    ```Dockerfile
    # Use an official Node runtime as a parent image
    FROM node:14

    # Set the working directory
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
    COPY . /app

    # Install any needed packages
    RUN npm install

    # Make port 8080 available to the world outside this container
    EXPOSE 8080

    # Run app when the container launches
    CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
    ```

3. **Create a GitHub Actions workflow:**
    ```yaml
    name: CI/CD Pipeline

    on:
      push:
         branches:
            - main

    jobs:
      build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest

         steps:
            - name: Checkout code
              uses: actions/checkout@v2

            - name: Set up Docker Buildx
              uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

            - name: Login to DockerHub
              uses: docker/login-action@v1
              with:
                 username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
                 password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

            - name: Build and push Docker image
              uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
              with:
                 push: true
                 tags: your-dockerhub-username/your-repo:latest
    ```

4. **Set up GitHub Secrets:**
    - `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username
    - `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password

5. **Push changes to GitHub:**
    ```sh
    git add .
    git commit -m "Set up CI/CD pipeline with Docker Hub"
    git push origin main
    ```

## Conclusion

This README provides a basic setup for an end-to-end GitHub Action workflow with Docker Hub. Customize the Dockerfile and workflow file according to your project's requirements.
